Very small population of Asian lions survive in India. The lions evolved between 1 million and 800,000 years ago in Africa. Lions are constantly being reduced but they are still not endangered.

When it comes to the length, the lion is larger than the lioness. The queen weighs from 120 to 182 kgs. A male lion has a mane. The majestic creature has a short life span.

The whole of their area includes 100 square miles of grasslands or open woodlands. These animals mark the area with urine. They roar to scare the other animals who try to walk into their area. They even chase the other animals from their place. Female lions are called as lioness. The lioness hunts for the group of lions. The group of lions is called as a pride. The female lions work together to hunt their prey. The pride enjoys their prey equally. They share with their young ones. The youngones are called as cubs. The cubs do not help to hunt untill they are a 1 year old. The lions are known for their team work. They are the only cats that stay in pride.", "imagePath": "pexels-photo-627667"}, {"text": "Lions are called to be big cats. These big cats have most of their behaviour similar to the pet cats at home. Lions are very good climbers. They are often seen up in trees checking the area for prey. Lions are awake only for 3 to 4 hours a day. Can you imagine? they spend their whole day in sleeping. Wow! that's strange, but it's true. They sleep in lots of unusual positions. They sleep on their back with their paws in air.
