I will stop at my house along the way and have a rest.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/19906.png"}, {"text": "Little Square Jojo was hot and tired by the time he reached his house. He went inside to open his freezer and pour a glass of cold water with ice blocks. \"I must be half the way to Mama Triangle's house,\" he said. \"I hope she has the chief's horn.\" Then Jojo had an idea. \"I can visit Dudu Diamond.

Mama Triangle's house was three kilometres away from where I started. I walked about half the way to get to my house, that's one and a half kilometres.
