He scolded her and hit her with a stick. Nosisa ran off to the river where she sat and cried the whole afternoon. Suddenly she heard a voice coming out of the river. She looked up and saw a big fish. The voice was coming from the fish. Nosisa was so shocked she almost ran away,  but the fish stopped her. \"Please don't run away my daughter,  I am your mother.

He found his new wife crying in her hut. \"What is wrong my lovely wife,\" asked Mpunzi. \"I went to a traditional doctor,\" said the wife. \"He told me that the only way for me to give you a son is to eat the biggest fish that lives in this nearby river,\" she said. \"Will you catch the fish for me tonight?\" pleaded the woman. \"I will do anything for you my beautiful wife,\" said Mpunzi.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1851.png"}, {"text": "Mpunzi set off to the river before it was too dark.
