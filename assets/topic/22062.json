One day,  Sinziro's brothers said to each other,  \"We are hungry,  but our enemy has many fat cows and bulls. Let's go tonight and steal two of his bulls.

I'm here,\" Sinziro called. \"And I know what to do. Stay here. I'll go inside the compound,  and open the door.

Go out!\" he shouted.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/19610.png"}, {"text": "The brothers' enemy was asleep in his house,  but his dogs were awake. They heard Sinziro,  and began to bark.

The owner was angry. \"Don't make so much noise,\" he said. \"We are trying to sleep.\" He went back into his house,  and shut the door.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/19612.png"}, {"text": "Quietly,  Sinziro drove the two bulls out of the compound. His brothers were very happy. \"What beautiful fat bulls!\" they said. \"Let's kill them and eat them now.\" \"No!\" said Sinziro. \"Our enemy will hear us. He will come out again and catch us. We must take the bulls far away,  across the river.\"", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/19613.png"}, {"text": "Sinziro and his brothers drove the bulls away from the enemy's house. When they came to the river,  the seven foolish brothers looked at the water and shook their heads. \"We can't cross this river,\" they said to each other. \"Perhaps it's deep. We can't swim. Where is Sinziro? He will know how to cross it.\"", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/19614.png"}, {"text": "Sinziro was sitting on one of the bulls' horns. \"I am here,  brothers,\" he said. \"I know what to do. Give me a rope.\" His brothers gave him a rope. Sinziro tied one end of the rope to the tree. Then he swam across the river,  and tied the other end to another tree. He called out to his brothers,  \"Hold the rope,  and walk across the river. You will be safe.\"", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/19615.png"}, {"text": "So,  one by one,  his brothers held the rope and crossed the river,  while the bulls swam in front of them. \"We are far away from our enemy now,\" said Sinziro. \"We can kill the bulls.\" The brothers killed the bulls.

No,  Sinziro,  there's no meat for you.\" Sinziro was very angry. \"I'll punish my brothers for this,\" he thought.

He took the bladder,  and ran ahead of his brothers. He climbed a tree near where they would pass. Sinziro tied up the bladder on one side,  and blew into it until it was like a ball. Then he took a stick and he began to beat the bladder.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/19618.png"}, {"text": "As he was making a noise with the stick and bladder,  Sinziro shouted,  \"Please,  don't beat me,  sir!
