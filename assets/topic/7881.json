The story appears in different versions in many southern African San communities. It warns foolish young men not to be confused by the outside appearance of a girl,  and tells parents not to force their children to marry for the sake of domestic help. It also provokes the powerful presence of the hot sun in the desert and does what stories do \u2013 give everything in nature a personality.
