You wouldn't be able to pay for them,  little spider.\"", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1282.png"}, {"text": "\"How much do the stories cost?\" asked Anansi. \"You'll have to bring me three rare and fierce animals,\" Nyame answered,  \"A leopard with sharp teeth like spears,  a hornet that stings people,  and a snake that swallows people whole.\" He laughed and laughed. He thought his stories were quite safe.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1283.png"}, {"text": "So Anansi climbed slowly back down his sticky thread to the earth. He thought and he thought,  and he came up with a plan. He dug a deep hole,  covered it with branches and dirt so it was hidden,  and he went home for supper. In the morning,  sure enough,  a leopard had fallen into his pit. He was furiously scratching at the side of the pit,  but he couldn't get out.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1284.png"}, {"text": "\"Oh let me help you,  my dear friend!\" said Anansi. \"Just lie down on these sticks and I'll pull you out.\" Anansi wound his sticky web round the leopard and the sticks,  and pulled him up to heaven to show the Sky God.

He thought and he thought and he came up with a plan. He took a gourd full of water and went to the tree where the hornets lived. He poured out some of the water all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a banana tree and held it over his head,  and he poured the rest of the water all over himself.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1287.png"}, {"text": "He called out to the hornets,  \"Hey hornets! Come see! It is raining! Quick - get inside my gourd and it will keep all of you dry.\" Hornets don't like to get wet,  so they all flew into Anansi's gourd.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1288.png"}, {"text": "Then Anansi quickly spun a web across the opening so the hornets couldn't get out no matter how much they buzzed. He carried them up to heaven and showed them to the Sky God.

He thought and thought and he thought,  but he couldn't come up with a plan. So he asked his wife,  who had a very good idea. Together they found a good long thick branch and some strong vines. When they got near the stream where the snake lived,  they began to argue. \"The branch is longer!\" \"No,  it isn't!\" \"Yes it is!\"", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1291.png"}, {"text": "Soon the snake came out and asked what the argument was. \"I was arguing with my wife,\" said Anansi. \"She says this stick is longer than you are.

Just put your stick next to me and measure!\"", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1292.png"}, {"text": "So Anansi did that,  and he tied the snake to the stick with his vine to keep him straight.
