This means they eat only and only meat. Eating is so fun and specially when we eat our favourite food. We just chew and chew and keep chewing. Now, stop there, crocodiles eat their favorite food too.

They change their body temperature accoring to the environment they are in. That means it's just like an air conditioner. If they need body warmth then they bathe in the sun. If they need to cool down, then they move into the water. These strong animals have strong sense organs too. Their acute senses makes them perfect predators. Can we see in the night? of course yes, but we need light to guide us. It's not the same with our crocodile friend. Their night vision is very good. So are their senses of smell and hearing.

Hence, the water monster.\nDid you know that, crocodiles are very strong swimmers. They can swim at a speed of 25 miles per hour. And this ability is because of its strong tail.
