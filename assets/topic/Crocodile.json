Small crocodiles are also the easiest prey to this wild predator. It sounds strange but true. It will not spare it's young ones too. Despite of being grouped under reptiles, crocodile is more closely related to dinosaur. It is believed to have been living alongside dinosaur and birds. we don't see the dinosaur anymore but crocodiles still survive.

The largest crocodile can grow from 13 to 18 feet and weigh upto 2200 pounds. The smallest being the dwarf in the crocodile family can reach 5 feet and will weigh around  40 to 70 pounds. Now, being a pure meat eater this water beast has twenty four sharp teeth.  The skin on their back contains bony structures which make them bullet proof. The skin on the belly is gentle. So, finally something is gentle.  They have a long snout which varies in shape and proportion. The nostrils, eye and ear opening are the highest part of the head. The body of the crocodile is streamlined with thier webbed feet tucking out. That's the amazing body features of the giant water monster.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/crocodile_8.jpg"}, {"text": "Crocodiles are carnivorous. This means they eat only and only meat. Eating is so fun and specially when we eat our favourite food. We just chew and chew and keep chewing. Now, stop there, crocodiles eat their favorite food too. But, eating is just swalloing for these wild water animals. They use their strong and sharp teeth to tear their prey into big pieces after clamping them down in their jaws. They swallow stones just as their prey for digestion. These stones help in grinding the food inside their stomach. Isn't that someting fascinating! Now, beware! don't you do the same.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/crocodile_9.jpg"}, {"text": "Crocodiles are cold blooded animals. They change their body temperature accoring to the environment they are in. That means it's just like an air conditioner. If they need body warmth then they bathe in the sun. If they need to cool down, then they move into the water. These strong animals have strong sense organs too. Their acute senses makes them perfect predators. Can we see in the night? of course yes, but we need light to guide us. It's not the same with our crocodile friend. Their night vision is very good. So are their senses of smell and hearing. With all these strong features, crocodiles live from 50 to 60 years and sometimes to 80 years. Great life of a great animal.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/crocodile_7.jpg"}, {"text": "Crocodile tears - Have you heard this somewhere? Crocodiles produce tears when they eat. No, its not for the dead prey, but its because they swallow too much air which gets in touch with the tear glands and hence the tears roll out. \nCrocodiles have one of the strongest bites in the whole of animal world. Hence, the water monster.\nDid you know that, crocodiles are very strong swimmers. They can swim at a speed of 25 miles per hour. And this ability is because of its strong tail. Wow, what a strong tail indeed!\nCrocodiles are often seen with their jaws wide open. Any guess! The fact is they open their jaws to cool themselves because they don't have sweat glands.\nA female crocodile lays 20 to 80 eggs and takes care of them for 3 months. and this is truly amazing.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/crocSnout_38.jpg"}], "gameDatas": [{"gameId": "MultipleChoiceGame", "question": "Crocodile is a _____________ blooded animal.", "answers": ["cold"], "choices": ["warm", "hot"]}, {"gameId": "MultipleChoiceGame", "question": "Bullet   ___________", "answers": ["proof"], "choices": ["jacket", "machine"]}, {"gameId": "MultipleChoiceGame", "question": "Sharp ___________", "answers": ["teeth"], "choices": ["tail", "eyes"]}, {"gameId": "MultipleChoiceGame", "question": "Identify the body parts and match it with their names", "answers": ["webbed feet", "assets/topic/crocfeet_30.jpg", "teeth", "assets/topic/crocTeeth_32.jpg", "tail", "assets/topic/crocTail_34.jpg", "eyes", "assets/topic/crocEye_36.jpg", "snout", "assets/topic/crocSnout_38.jpg"], "choices": []}, {"gameId": "MultipleChoiceGame", "question": "Crocodiles's can live upto 1000 years.", "answers": ["False"], "choices": ["True"]}, {"gameId": "MultipleChoiceGame", "question": "Crocodiles are carnivorous animals.", "answers": ["Yes"], "choices": ["no"]}, {"gameId": "MultipleChoiceGame", "question": "crocodile  _______", "answers": ["tears"], "choices": ["cakes", "mistakes"]}], "storyId": "Crocodile", "coverImagePath": "assets/topic/crocodile.svg", "title": "Crocodile"}
