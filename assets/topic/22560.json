While Aku fished with her father, she wondered why the sun always looked at her from the sky.\nSometimes Aku helped her mother, A'anua to cook. Aku wondered why palm oil looked red in calabash but yellow in yam pottage.",

The birds too did not tweet.\nAnd without the sun in Sunland, people could not go about their daily activities. Farmers  could not go to tend their crops. And the sky was grey and sad. Ataa Ankra could not go fishing. Children too could not prepare for school. And women could not go to the market to haggle over the prices of soap and kerosene.\nAku missed all these. She missed the cock crows and bird tweets too. And she missed the sunrise more.",

And the sun has not travelled. Or it would have first told me.\"\nSome people chuckled at what Aku said. She continued anyway, \"I tell the truth. The sun is my friend. The sun is not dead. It is only \u2013\". But no one would hear anymore. Everyone forgot about the sun. They laughed hard at Aku. The children laughed too.\nThe children's laughter pained Aku the most.",

A'anua saw Aku holding the ball. Before she could call Aku and scold her, Aku ran past her.\nOti, A'anua and all the people of Sunland watched Aku run away.

Then a big ball came from behind the clouds. The ball was bright. And it was red and yellow like palm oil. The ball was the sun. Aku's sun.\nEverything stirred. The quietness left.",
