Zebras belong to horse family but they are very much unique.  But horses and donkeys are their close relatives. There are three different types of zebras. The plains zebra, the mountain zebra and the grevvy's zebra. The plains zebra are found in the treeless grasslands and woodlands of eastern and southern Africa. The mountain zebras are native to mountainous regions of southwestern Africa. The Grevvy's zebra are found in small areas of Kenya and Ethopia. The Gravvy's zebra weighs around 350 - 450 kilograms. The mountain zebra weighs around 240 to 372 kilograms and the Plains zebra weighs around 350 kilograms. Wow! that's truly a heavy weight.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/zebra_5.jpg"}, {"text": "Zebras live in family groups led by a male zebra with several female zebras and offsprings. The male zebra is known as a stallion. The female zebra is known as a mare. The baby zebra is known as a foal.\nZebras mostly eat grass and will travel upto 1800 miles in search of food. Being herbivorous they sometimes eat barks, twigs and also leaves. Female zebras carry their youngones in womb for a period of 12 to 14 months.

Aren't these habits unique!", "imagePath": "assets/topic/zebraArticle_9.jpg"}, {"text": "Zebras are often found among other animal groups, especially the wild beasts for safety in numbers. A large herd of animals are usually confusing to the predators. Zebras have several ways to communicate with one another. Facial expressions, such as wide-open eyes or barred teeth, all mean something. They also bark, bray, snort or huff to get their point across. Even the position of their ears signal their feelings. They can rotate their ears to almost any direction. Zebras sleep standing up and its really cool. Do you think you will be able to fall asleep standing up? and, they sleep only when they are in the safety of their group. Aren't their social bonding amazing!", "imagePath": "assets/topic/zebra_5.jpg"}, {"text": "The swahili name of a zebra is \"Punda Milia\"\nThis is super cool!
