One day while Gingile was out hunting he heard the call of Ngede. Gingile's mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He stopped and listened carefully,  searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his head. \"Chitik-chitik-chitik,\" the little bird rattled,  as he flew to the next tree,  and the next. \"Chitik,  chitik,  chitik,\" he called,  stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed.", "option": null}, {"id": "2344_4", "type": "knowledge", "title": null, "header": "assets/topic/asb/1866.png", "content": "After half an hour,  they reached a huge wild fig tree.
