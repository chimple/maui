After they washed the dishes,  Simbegwire's father helped her with homework.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1675.png"}, {"text": "One day,  Simbegwire's father came home later than usual. \"Where are you my child?\" he called. Simbegwire ran to her father. She stopped still when she saw that he was holding a woman's hand. \"I want you to meet someone special,  my child. This is Anita,\" he said smiling.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1676.png"}, {"text": "\"Hello Simbegwire,  your father told me a lot about you,\" said Anita. But she did not smile or take the girl's hand. Simbegwire's father was happy and excited.

She no longer had time to sit with her father in the mornings. Anita gave her so many household chores that she was too tired to do her school work in the evenings.

Anita did not say anything. She was not happy either.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1679.png"}, {"text": "Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she didn't finish her chores,  or she complained,  Anita hit her. And at dinner,  the woman ate most of the food,  leaving Simbegwire with only a few scraps.

As she went to sleep,  she sang: Maama,  maama,  maama,  you left me. You left me and never came back. Father doesn't love me anymore. Mother,  when are you coming back? You left me.", "imagePath": "assets/topic/asb/1682.png"}, {"text": "The next morning,  Simbegwire sang the song again.

The woman explained that Simbegwire had run away. \"I wanted her to respect me,\" she said. \"But perhaps I was too strict.\" Simbegwire's father left the house and went in the direction of the stream.

She was scared he might be angry,  so she ran inside the house to hide. But her father went to her and said,  \"Simbegwire,  you have found a perfect mother for yourself.
